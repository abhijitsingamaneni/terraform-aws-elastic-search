# terraform-aws-elastic-search
This repo is used to create AWS Elastic search
## ToDo

AWS introduced it's own open source licensed plugins for ElasticSearch. They call it OpenDistro for ElasticSearch.

Once it is done we need to update it to the new code. until then we have to do the creation of Elasticsearch with opendistro through console
